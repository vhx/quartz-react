# React Components for VHX Quartz

### Installation

For now, clone the repo and run:

```bash
npm install
```


## NPM Scripts

- **`npm start`**: This is the main script you'll use while developing components for quartz-react. It starts a local server to display the demo ui with live reloading and runs the build process.
- **`npm run build`**: Run this before any release. It transpiles the source code and puts the output in `dist/`.
- **`npm test`**: This script runs the tests for all the components and utilities in a jsdom environment.
- **`npm run dev` and `npm run serve`**: Together, these two scripts form the start script. `dev` transpiles and watches the source code for changes and `serve` creates a local server to display the demos.


## Folder Hierarchy
```
build/
  rollup.config.js              # Configuration for the bundler
components/
  [Component]/                  # At minimum contains the following files, but can be extended as necessary
    index.js                    # This just exports your [Component].jsx
    [Component].jsx             # The main component file
    [Component].test.jsx        # Unit tests for the component
  util/                         # Utility functions shared by components
demo/
  public/                       # Assets to be used by the demo page
  src/
    ui/                         # Components specific to the demo page, such as its sidebar navigation
    demos/                      # Each section of the demo page comes from files in this directory
    index.jsx                   # The demo page itself (ie. what is seen on localhost:3000)
index.js                        # Every component that is exported in quartz-react
```


## How to Create a New Component

1. Create a branch for the new component
2. In `components/` add a folder for your component that contains the following files:
    - index.js
    - [YourComponent].jsx
    - [YourComponent].test.jsx
3. In the root level `index.js`, create a named export for your component.
4. In `demo/src/demos/` create a file to demo your component (by convention, it should be `demo/src/demos/[YourComponent].jsx`). It should export a react component that makes use of the demo UI components (see below).
5. In `demo/src/index.jsx` import the demo you exported from the file in step 4, and add it to the `sections` object. This will include it in the sidebar navigation as well as render it to the page.
6. Create a pull request and merge into master when ready. Then delete the branch.


## Demo UI Components

Component demo files (`demo/src/demos/*.jsx`) should export a component containing `<DemoRow>`s. These accept an optional `code` prop that's a string of code to display on the right side of the page.

Follow the example from the `Text` component's demo for the simplest example setup.
